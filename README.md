## Overview

This is a random advice generator which uses slip advice's API. Loads advice asynchronously by clicking on the button.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- JavaScript


### What I learned

This project required the use of the box-shadow property, and responsive text units. Also required the use of Fetch to work with the slip advice API, transforming the resulting string into JSON array in order to access advice number and text.

### Continued development

I'll get more in-depth with asynchronous JS, and experiment with the different options fetch gives.
